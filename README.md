# What It Is
Swiss army knife LSM implementation.

#### History
LAB which is short for 'leaps and bounds' was originally develop by Kevin Karpenske and myself when we both worked at JiveSoftware LLC. This is a fork of that original work. Even though the orginal code base was in the open source it was never published to maven central. This repository is in an effort to get these codes released to maven central and also allow them to evolve independant of the original work.


#### Getting Started
Check out LAB over at [the wiki](https://github.com/jnthnclt/lab/wiki).

Leaps And Bounds is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See LICENSE for full license text.
