# lab
Java LSM implementation.

# History
LAB which is short for 'leaps and bounds' was aoriginally develop by Kevin Karpenske and myself when we both worked at JiveSoftware LLC. This is a fork of that original work. Even though the orginal code base was int the open source it was never published to maven central. This repository is in an effort to get these codes release to maven central and also allow them to evolve independant of the original work.
